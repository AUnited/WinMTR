#### Differences to [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/) 0.98
- `[x]` - removed Windows 2000 support <br>
- `[x]` + added IPv6 support <br>
- `[x]` + clickable entries when stopped.. *(why the heck wasn't it possible before?)* <br>
- `[x]` * added start delay of about 30ms for each hop *(870ms before the 30th hop gets queried) <br>
this should improve performance and reduces network load* <br>

- `[x]` * theme support *(more fancy look :P)* <br>
- ~~`[ ]` + remembers window size~~ <br>
- `[ ]` ! CTRL+A works for host input <br>
- `[ ]` + host history: pressing del key or right mouse will remove selected entry <br>
- `[ ]` * new icon <br>
