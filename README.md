### Fork history
There isn't that much to say actually, I've been using IPv6 for a few years now thanks to [**SixXS**](http://sixxs.net/)
and it always annoyed me that WinMTR couldn't handle IPv6... finally my ISP got some sort of IPv6 beta test.
And that's what I wanted to compare: native vs SixXS with long-term trace routes such as those WinMTR provides. <br>
Since there wasn't any WinMTR build with IPv6, I decided to do it myself ;) The result can be seen here :P <br>
*(after 1 day for IPv6, and 2 additional days to fix other stuff and polishing)*
